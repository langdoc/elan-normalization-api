# elan-normaliztion-api

## Introduction

This is just an example of connecting a web service into ELAN, in this case the idea is to run a normalization pattern before running any other NLP tools. Ideally the web service could be linked with other WebLicht tools.

At the moment it only replaces every second character in the string with x, but more elaborate and useful patterns can be easily imagined.

More advanced example of the same approach with various links and references can be seen in [elan-gt-api](https://github.com/langdoc/elan-gt-api).
